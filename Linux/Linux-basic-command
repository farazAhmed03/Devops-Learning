#Folder and File Basics (Navigation & Management)

pwd                  → Show current directory (where you are right now)
ls                   → List files and folders in current directory
ls -l                → List with details (permissions, size, date)
ls -la               → Show hidden files too (files starting with .)
cd Desktop           → Go into the Desktop folder
cd ..                → Go one folder up (back)
cd ~                 → Go to your home folder
cd /                 → Go to root (top level of the system)
mkdir myfolder       → Create a new folder
mkdir -p folder/subfolder → Create folders inside folders (no error if already exists)
touch file.txt       → Create a new empty file (or update timestamp)
cp file.txt backup.txt → Copy a file
cp -r folder1 folder2 → Copy entire folder (with everything inside)
mv oldname newname   → Rename file/folder or move it
rm file.txt          → Delete a file
rm -r folder         → Delete entire folder (be careful!)
rm -rf folder        → Force delete folder (no questions asked – very dangerous!)

#Viewing Files and Checking Logs

tail -f file.log     → Follow live logs (great for watching running apps)
